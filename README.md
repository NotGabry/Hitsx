<h2> ðŸ’¢ How this work? </h2>

It's very easy, every time that the badge is loaded our API add 1 to the total count of hits.

If you want to use our API make a **POST** request to `https://hitsx.up.railway.app/api/fetch` and add in the body an item named `ID` with your website's URL.  
NOTE **If you use your custom fetch system make sure that when you display your badge add `&devOptions=nofetch` at the end of link's path**

- Text Color, add `&textColor=hex color` at the end of link
